**AForte** is a Bowen signature programme designed to cater to the holistic development of students from the Normal stream.

### Objectives

Coined from the word "_Forte_ - a talent/skill in which a person excels in", our **AForte** programme aims to ensure that students are engaged in classroom learning, enthusiastic to attend school and most importantly, to broaden their learning experiences.  AForte provides a range of meaningful activities to help them maximise their potential and discover their interests and talents.

AForte encourages students to work on the following **4 key areas**:  

*   **A**ttitude (values and character), 
*   **A**ttendance (both daily lessons and CCA), 
*   **A**cademic performance (studies and grades) and 
*   **A**spirations (target post-secondary course and ambition).
