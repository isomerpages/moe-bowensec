### Overseas Learning Journies and Culturing Immersion Programmes

The Bowen Horizons provides experiential learning experiences for our students through carefully planned Overseas Learning journeys and cultural immersion programmes. 

  

 These trips allow our students to experience what it is like to study in a different cultural, linguistic and/or social environment to what they are so familiar with in Singapore. It also gives Bowenians, the opportunity to widen their horizons and enlarge their global perspectives and to reflect critically on their own experience in another country, an unfamiliar culture, their 'home' culture or ethnic group.
