The **Bowen ChANgeMakers** programme is a **signature programme** that envisions all Bowenians as creative thinkers and future innovators who are able to use a spirit of enterprise to do good for others. 

  

Through this, Bowenians learn what it means to be a 21st century leader: empathetic, socially responsible and inventive individuals who will view problems as opportunities to engineer change. **Bowen ChANgeMakers** is an integration of Bowen’s _Applied Learning_ and _Lifelong Learning Programmes_.

### Secondary 1: ChANgeMakers in the School @ Bowen

Over two terms, Sec 1 students utilise the design thinking methodology to search for ways to improve the school environment or community. Putting themselves in the shoes of a range of stakeholders—students, teachers, cleaners, canteen stall operators, security officers and more—they are tasked to design and prototype solutions to tackle issues ranging from learning issues, dirty classrooms, canteen queues, protecting the environment and more.    

This culminates in a project showcase where they get the chance to hone their presentation skills by pitching their ideas to teachers, addressing queries and finally will harnessing votes to be the best projects in a few categories.
