In Bowen, the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) learning environment support students to learn with technology. PDLP is an enabling factor to promote learning for life and the joy of learning to complement strategic initiatives such as (a) CCE 2021&nbsp; (b) FSBB (C) SIL/BL. This should in turn encourage our Bowenian to be developed as a Learner, a Leader and a Champion who learns actively, learns with others and learns by doing it right, with confidence and moral conviction.

As “Active Learners”, Bowenians seek to actively make sense of the materials used in learning and deepen one’s knowledge, by leveraging on the use of the PDLP learning environment.&nbsp;Self-management is integral to being an active learner, and in the PDLP environment, one should take advantage of a suite of applications by Google and other software providers to be productive in one’s learning for example:  <br>
a. Students Learning Space (SLS)  <br>
b) Google Productivity tools (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.)  <br>
c) Google Classroom  <br>
d) Google Calendar

While learning requires one to be self-responsible and accountable, it can also be a social experience. One learns with others, with students and teachers and progress as a result as a team because learning becomes deep when done collaboratively.

The use of technology is a leverage to help students acquire skills to create meaningful content, share and negotiate differing perspectives and manage social interactions. The R-E-A-D-Y BE\*! learning routines developed should assist students to navigate the 21st century world both online and offline with a measure of savviness that is founded on sound pro-social values.&nbsp;**_‘Doing Right’_**&nbsp;&nbsp;is an essential aspect of learning in the PDLP environment as one ‘Do the Right Thing’ (CCE) and ‘Be an Upstander’ (PSR).
