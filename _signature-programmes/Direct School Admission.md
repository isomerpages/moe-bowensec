The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to apply to a participating secondary school based on their diverse talents and potential, beyond their performance at the PSLE. Students can consider applying for a secondary school that offers their talent area through DSA-Sec. Upon admission, students develop these talents further in their secondary school. In accepting an offer of admission through DSA-Sec, students are expressing a commitment to study in that school to develop their talent in the chosen area.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
