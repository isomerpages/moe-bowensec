The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to seek admission to a participating secondary school based on their talents and achievements before the release of their PSLE results. Students may consider applying for a secondary school through DSA-Sec if they are able to identify a school that offers a talent development programme in their area of strength, as well as commit to developing their talents in the chosen DSA area, in that particular school.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the pace of learning and overall range of programmes offered by the schools. Finding a good fit will help students enjoy their learning at an appropriate pace and benefit the school’s programmes.
