<h3>Direct School Admission (DSA) for Academic Year 2026</h3>
<p>The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to apply to a participating
secondary school based on their diverse talents and potential, beyond their
performance at the PSLE. Students can consider applying for a secondary
school that offers their talent area through DSA-Sec. Upon admission, students

the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
