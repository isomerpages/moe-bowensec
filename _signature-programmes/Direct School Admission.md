<h3>Direct School Admission (DSA) for 2026</h3>
<p>The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to apply to a participating
secondary school based on their diverse talents and potential, beyond their
performance at the PSLE. Students can consider applying for a secondary
school that offers their talent area through DSA-Sec. Upon admission, students
develop these talents further in their secondary school. In accepting an
offer of admission through DSA-Sec, students are expressing a commitment
to study in that school to develop their talent in the chosen area.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent</p>
