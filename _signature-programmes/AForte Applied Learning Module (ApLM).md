<h4><strong>The Bowen AForte ApLM</strong></h4>
<p>Applied Learning Modules (ApLMs) were introduced by the Ministry of Education
(MOE) to enrich the secondary school curriculum with more applied learning
options.</p>
<p><strong>AForte</strong>&nbsp;is a Bowen signature Applied Learning Module
(ApLM) designed to cater to the holistic development of students from the
Normal stream.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Coined from the word "<em>Forte</em>&nbsp;- a talent/skill in which a
person excels in", our&nbsp;<strong>AForte</strong>&nbsp;programme aims
to ensure that students are engaged in classroom learning, enthusiastic
to attend school and most importantly, to broaden their learning experiences.
&nbsp;AForte provides a range of meaningful activities to help them&nbsp;maximise&nbsp;their
potential and discover their interests and talents.</p>
<p>AForte encourages students to work on the following&nbsp;<strong>4 key areas</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>ttitude (values and character),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>ttendance (both daily lessons and CCA),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>cademic performance (studies and grades) and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>spirations (target post-secondary course and ambition).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Learning Activities</h4>
<p>Our programme includes 3 key learning activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Building self</strong>&nbsp;– students attend multi-week programmes
to help them develop the necessary life skills to recognize and manage
emotions, make responsible and thoughtful decisions and establish positive
relationships with others. Lower secondary classes are involved in The
Scaffold Programme which focuses on building healthy and encouraging relationships
within the class. The Beauty Unravelled Programme caters to female students
and helps them to discover their inner beauty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discovering strengths and building interest</strong>&nbsp;– students
attend annual Sports Discovery programmes to experience and explore different
sports such as bowling, kin ball, fencing, golf and unarmed&nbsp;self-defence&nbsp;techniques
(Muay Thai). From Sec 1 to Sec 4, students will experience up to 4 Sports
Discovery sessions.&nbsp; Students also attend the Experience ITE Programme
to expose them to the wide variety of courses and learning opportunities
offered at ITE, both full-time and apprenticeship programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploring career options</strong>&nbsp;– students attend Elective
Modules (EM) conducted in school and at ITE, for a variety of areas including
Aeronautics, E-Entrepreneurship, Food Science Culinary, Photography&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mechatronics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These modules serve to extend what they learn in their subjects and give
students insight into the jobs and industries that they might be interested
in. From Sec 2 to Sec 4, students can experience up to 3 EMs.&nbsp; Students
can also get to visit polytechnics and&nbsp;ITE,&nbsp;and take part in
various post-secondary competitions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the school’will support students to learn more about post-secondary
options and career possibilities.</p>
<h3>CARE-Bean</h3>
<p>Care-Bean is an activity room tucked at a corner next to the school hall
where students are welcome to drop and enjoy a healthy dose of fun activities
to wind down and recharge.</p>
<p>It was first conceptualised as a community project, an outcome of a collaboration
that the school undertook together with the Singapore Children's Society.
Then, it was known as 'Project Cabin'. The school has continued 'Project
Cabin' and reposition it as part of the school care effort. The space is
now renamed as&nbsp;<strong>'CARE-bean Corner'</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>'CARE-bean Corner'</strong>&nbsp;<strong>remains</strong>&nbsp;an
outreach platform, engaging our students through an array of student-centred
activities. At&nbsp;<strong>'CARE-bean Corner'</strong>, we availed to&nbsp;our
students fun and learning resources like gaming consoles and board games.
The school Care Team that is now running the space hopes to strengthen
stronger school engagement for our students by providing a space that promotes
healthy social interaction through fun and learning.</p>
