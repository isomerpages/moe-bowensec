<b><i>“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”</i></b>

<b><i>~ Carl Strong</b></i>

The Bowen Science Department aims to equip students not just with scientific knowledge and skills but also a scientific way of thinking so that students will be able to make informed decisions about emerging science-related issues which are important to self and society. 

This is achieved through the use of the Inquiry Based approach for lessons and activities. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of   

a. Knowledge, Understanding and Application,<br>
b) Skills and Processes and<br>
c) Ethics and Attitudes.<br>
