<p>The Bowen Humanities programme aims to develop informed, concerned and
participative citizens who cares deeply for his family, community and nation.
He takes on an active role in bettering the lives of other around him.</p>
<p>The department strives to develop a creative and inquiring mind; one who
is able to think critically and has the necessary dispositions and skills
to take on challenges of the future. This is achieved through the use of
Inquiry-based learning as well as the various programmes.</p>

<p>Opportunities for outdoor learning make learning the Humanities exciting!
They engage in experiential learning which helps students develop critical
thinking skills, gain deeper appreciation of the humanities and develop
interpersonal skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students become actively involved in the learning process as they:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>act upon their curiosity and interests;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop questions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>think their way through controversies or dilemmas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>look at problems analytically;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inquire into their preconceptions and what they already know;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, clarify, and test hypotheses; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>draw inferences and generate possible solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In Historical Investigations, students explore a range of authentic sources
to glean perspectives of the lives of people in the past.</p>
<p>Students also navigate through various historical sites in Singapore and
encounter authentic learning experiences which help them connect with their
learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 -&nbsp; Fort Canning, National Museum of Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 2 - National Museum of Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 4 &amp; 5 - Internal Security Department, Heritage Gallery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geographical Investigations</h3>
<p>Lower Secondary students tested the water for turbidity, dissolved oxygen
and pH values at Bishan-AMK Park to better appreciate the clean waters
in Singapore. They also traced the development of public housing at HDB
Hub and investigated special places in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Upper Secondary students investigated the micro-climate in school as well
as surveyed tourists to research on their impact on Chinatown.&nbsp;Pure
Geography students also saw geography come to life at East Coast Park while
investigating beach profile and longshore drift, tasks that help them connect
textbook theories to real-life occurrences.</p>
