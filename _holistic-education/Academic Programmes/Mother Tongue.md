The Mother Tongue Department aims to empower Bowenians to succeed in the 21st Century by: 

1.  Developing their proficiency and ability to communicate in the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) 
    
    - a valuable skill for life and work, which gives our students a competitive edge. 
2.  Cultivating deeper appreciation of culture, history and values through learning of Mother Tongue Languages, 
    
    - and hence retain our Asian roots and values while embracing globalisation.
