Every Bowenian a Future-Ready and Responsible Digital Learners. Bowen ICT Department aims to enhance our students’ learning experience through meaningful and impactful infusion of ICT into our structured programmes and curriculum. Bowenians have to stay current to the fast paced technological changes and 21st century skills should be developed in every Bowenian.

### Use of Technology in Bowen

In Bowen, we tap on the affordances of ICT in order to enhance the learning experiences of all Bowenians. We strive to use ICT as an effective platform for the development of **21st Century Competencies** in order to nurture **Bowenians** to be **“Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners”.**  

In Bowen, all secondary 1 to 4 students will have their own Personal Learning Device (PLD) ie. Convertible Chromebook. PLDs are setup to automatically connect to school’s wireless network.

Students are expected to **Responsibly Use** their PLDs and school wired/wireless network for research and learning purposes only.

### Student Login Accounts in Bowen

There are several on-line login platforms available for Bowenians.  Every student should be familiar with the platforms available and remember their UserIDs.  Some platforms share common UserIDs, while others use different UserIDs.    

These tables list the various login platforms available for students.
