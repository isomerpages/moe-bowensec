# Music Programme
Bowen's Music Programme adopts a practical approach to developing Listening, Performing and Composing skills in our students, as well as to develop critical and creative thinking skills. These skills provide the basis for meaningful engagement with music at any level, regardless of students' prior experiences.Â 
  
The Programme utilizes a variety of instruments, from keyboards, percussion and guitars, to electronic media using tablets and computers. Learning Journeys to watch world-class performances augment the programme to enrich our students' musical and artistic learning.
