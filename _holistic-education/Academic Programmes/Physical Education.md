<p>lifelong participation in wholesome, recreational and cultural activities</p>

</ul>
<h3>OUR PE CURRICULUM</h3>
<p>Over the 4-5 years in Bowen, our students will learn how to play a variety
of sports and games, and maintain physical fitness. A cognitive approach
is taken to enable our students to appreciate and understand the different
sports. Through concept-based lessons, students are encouraged to think
critically and creatively devising strategies for game play. It is also
our aim to develop purposeful and stimulating lessons and activities that
will strengthen our students’ affective and social skills, foster character
building and cultivate the desirable qualities of sportsmanship.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the games &amp; sports and outdoor education lessons, our students
also go through a series of Physical Health and Fitness lessons that are
designed to equip them with the relevant sports-related knowledge which
will serve as a good foundation if they wish to take up Exercise &amp;
Sports Science (ESS) as a GCE ‘O’ Level subject in Upper Secondary.</p>
