<p>The overarching goal of mathematics education in the school is to provide
our students with a good foundation in Mathematics that is necessary for
problem-solving as well as daily life application. We strive to instill
in our students the positive attitude towards the learning of the subjects.</p>
<h4><strong>Mathematics for all</strong></h4>
<p>All students are required to read Elementary Mathematics from Secondary
One to Five, and mathematical-inclined students are offered to read Additional
Mathematics when they advanced to Secondary Three. In line with MOE’s continual
effort to improve educational programmes to better cater to students’ different
needs, abilities and aspirations, the Subject Based Banding (SBB) which
starts at Sec 1 and SBB inserts at Sec 1 mid-yr and Sec 1 end-year will
give our students more opportunities to be offered a more demanding course.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Pedagogy</strong>
<br>The student is at the centre of our focus. We look into the different
learning needs and abilities of students in the school. Through professional
sharing, we discuss and explore teaching ideas and strategies which we
can practice in the classroom to engage them. E-learning is one of the
ways of learning Mathematics among our students. Through e-learning, we
believe that it helps to reinforce concepts learnt in the classroom as
well as to enable them learn the subject at their own pace and space from
the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>We also have supplementary/ remedial lessons after curriculum hours to
help selected students who are weak in the subject. As part of the department’s
strategy to prepare our students for their National Examinations, we provide
personalised consultation after school for our graduating classes as well
as provide small group tutoring to those who need the extra help.</p>
