In line with the 21st CC competencies, the Craft and Technology Department aims to develop a child to be a creative and inventive thinker. They learn to solve problems and create products using various mediums, be it food, wood, steel or art.

As part of their learning process, students identify problems, generate ideas and test their ideas. Students are encouraged to marry function with fashion, to be pragmatic and aesthetic. We hope for our students to be able to carry these skills through life and apply their knowledge and learning to real-world problems and situations.

The Design and Technology (D&T) department seeks to enhance Bowenians’ learning experience of the subject through the incorporation of the Design Thinking Process . This is to develop the 21st century skillset of Critical and Inventive Thinking in our students’ experience of the subject. 

The goal of D&T education is to nurture in our pupils a way of thinking and doing – designerly dispositions which are inherent in design practices – through designing and making. 

These designerly dispositions include:

*   embracing uncertainties and complexities
*   be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined problems
*   relentless drive to seek out how things work
*   use of doodling and sketching, and 
*   3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication, and presentation.
