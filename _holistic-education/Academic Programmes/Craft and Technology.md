<p>In line with the 21st&nbsp;CC competencies, the Craft and Technology Department
aims to develop a child to be a creative and inventive thinker. They learn
to solve problems and create products using various mediums, be it food,
wood, steel or art.</p>
<p>As part of their learning process, students identify problems, generate
ideas and test their ideas. Students are encouraged to marry function with
fashion, to be pragmatic and aesthetic.</p>
<p>We hope for our students to be able to carry these skills through life
and apply their knowledge and learning to real-world problems and situations.</p>

<p>The Design and Technology (D&amp;T) department seeks to enhance Bowenians’
learning experience of the subject&nbsp;through the incorporation of the
Design&nbsp;Thinking&nbsp;Process . This is to develop the&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century&nbsp;skillset
of Critical and Inventive Thinking in our students’ experience of the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of D&amp;T education is to nurture in our pupils a way of thinking
and doing –&nbsp;designerly dispositions which are inherent in design practices
– through designing and&nbsp;making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These designerly dispositions include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>embracing uncertainties and complexities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relentless&nbsp;drive to seek out how things work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use of doodling and sketching, and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3D manipulation of resistant materials as a&nbsp;language for&nbsp;visualisation,
communication,&nbsp;and&nbsp;presentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Food and Nutrition (FN)</h3>
<p>The Food and Consumer Education program aims to educate students to be
health-conscious and discerning consumers. This enables them to better
manage their lives for the present and the future. Through the lessons,
students are equipped with life skills that&nbsp;optimise&nbsp;their resources
of food, finance and time to meet their physical, mental, social and economic
needs.</p>
<p>We take an innovative approach and aim to make the learning of the subject
relevant, interesting and enjoyable for the students. By equipping our
students with practical life skills through various activities such as
investigative activities, planning balanced meals through supermarkets
and canteen visits, they learn to connect what they learn with their own
lives.</p>
<p>Some activities students enjoyed were Action-Research projects and level-based
cooking competitions.&nbsp; In "Food in our Canteen" Action research project,
various classes went to the canteen and approached the canteen vendors.
Through their conversations with the vendors, students have found about
more how their canteen food&nbsp;were&nbsp;cooked. They also came up with
suggestions on how to improve the nutritive value of the food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cooking competition was open to Secondary 2 students and the aim was
to discover Bowen’s young cooking talents. Through the competition, the
students got an opportunity to unleash and discover their inner talents,
develop their cooking skills, all while having fun.</p>

includes the appreciation and use of several software application packages
for word processing, computer drawing and image editing, multimedia presentations&nbsp;and&nbsp;documents,
