In line with the 21stÂ CC competencies, the Craft and Technology Department aims to develop a child to be a creative and inventive thinker. They learn to solve problems and create products using various mediums, be it food, wood, steel or art.

As part of their learning process, students identify problems, generate ideas and test their ideas. Students are encouraged to marry function with fashion, to be pragmatic and aesthetic. We hope for our students to be able to carry these skills through life and apply their knowledge and learning to real-world problems and situations.
