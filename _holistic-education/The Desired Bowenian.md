<h3>The Desired Bowenian</h3>
<p>Bowenians strive to Do Well in all areas, both in their academic and non-academic
pursuits to take on challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Guided by a sound moral compass, Bowenians strive to Do Good by learning
to be more selfless and to want to make a difference in the community around
them.</p>
<p>Our motto, 'I Believe, Therefore I Am' reflects our belief that Bowenians
can fulfill their aspirations when they believe in their abilities and
strive for excellence.</p>
<p>The ideal Bowenian is a well-balanced all-rounded individual. He is a
confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, and is adaptable
and resilient.</p>
<p>He believes and knows himself and engages in meaningful service for others.
He is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and
communicates effectively.</p>
