### The Desired Bowenian

Bowenians strive to Do Well in all areas, both in their academic and non-academic pursuits to take on challenges of the future.

Guided by a sound moral compass, Bowenians strive to Do Good by learning to be more selfless and to want to make a difference in the community around them. 

Our motto, 'I Believe, Therefore I Am' reflects our belief that Bowenians can fulfill their aspirations when they believe in their abilities and strive for excellence. 

The ideal Bowenian is a well-balanced all-rounded individual. He is a confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, and is adaptable and resilient. 

He believes and knows himself and engages in meaningful service for others. He is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively.
