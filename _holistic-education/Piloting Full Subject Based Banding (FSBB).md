In March 2019, then Minister for Education, Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that Streaming would be replaced by [Full Subject Based Banding (SBB)](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/streaming-into-normal-and-express-in-secondary-schools-to-stop-in-2024-to-be). He said, 

“The **school system will become far more flexible** than today, so that we can **customise learning to the student**, to give them time to blossom at different points in their lives.”  

Bowen Secondary is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by MOE to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB). The pilot began in 2020 and is doing well.
