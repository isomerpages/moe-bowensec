In March 2019, then Minister for Education, Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that Streaming would be replaced by [Full Subject Based Banding (SBB)](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/streaming-into-normal-and-express-in-secondary-schools-to-stop-in-2024-to-be). He said, 

“The **school system will become far more flexible** than today, so that we can **customise learning to the student**, to give them time to blossom at different points in their lives.”  

Bowen Secondary is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by MOE to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB). The pilot began in 2020 and is doing well.

### The Full SBB pilot in Bowen


The Full SBB pilot in Bowen will involve two aspects:

First, **Secondary 1 students joining Bowen will get a richer student experience as they will get to be part of two classes:**

*   **The Form Class**, where they will build their socio-emotional skills and take hands-on subjects like Art, D&T and F&N. Students will also do CCE, Music and PE in their form class. The Form Class will comprise students from all 3 streams.  
      
    
*   **The Teaching Group** where they will take subjects like EL, MTL, Maths, Science, etc. pitched at the level which will suit their learning ability. 

*   NA and NT students who are strong at EL, MTL, Maths and/or Science and who meet MOE-criteria, can study these subjects at NA / Exp levels1. 
*   Express students will offer these subjects at Express level.

  

**A richer student experience:**  

*   **This two-class arrangement** will give them both the opportunity to socialise and build a strong sense of community, as well as the opportunity to study EL, MTL etc. with peers who can spur them on. 
*   In the form classes, we will implement **‘buddy groups’** comprising 2-4 students, for students to provide mutual support. We will have ‘**Class Bonding Time’** every Friday for the classes bond over a game or over breakfast. 
*   Students will attend **enrichment programmes** in both their form class (E.g. Leadership programmes) and teaching group (Learning Journey to Science Centre) so that the students will be able to enjoy the best of both worlds.

  

Second, **Sec 2N(A) students who are eligible can offer Geography and/or History at Sec 2 Exp level, to help them further their strengths and interests**

*   Students in Sec 1N(A) can offer Geography and/or History at Express level when they start Sec 2 if they meet the following criteria for the Sec 1 year-end result(s): 

*   **Geography 75% and above**
*   **History 75% and above**

*   If they do well in these subjects at Sec 2Exp level, they may be offered the subject at O level in Sec 3N(A) and Sec 4N(A).

-------

<u>Note 1:</u>

*   NA and NT students, who do not meet MOE criteria to offer these subjects at Exp / NA level when they enter at Sec 1, can aspire to do well and study hard.  If they meet the relevant criteria at mid-year / year-end of Sec 1, they will be offered these subjects at E/NA levels. 

*   Currently, NA and NT students, who meet the relevant criteria to transfer streams to Exp / NA at the end of Sec 1 or Sec 2, are offered the chance to transfer.  With Full SBB, this will continue to be the case.

<u>Note 2:</u>

*   Geography and/or History at Sec 2N(A) level has been made available for Sec 2N(T) students since Jan 2021.
