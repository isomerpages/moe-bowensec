<p>The Bowenian Pledge serves to <strong>complement</strong>  <strong><em>R-E-A-D-Y BE! - </em></strong>to
encourage all Bowenians to adopt the learning dispositions and practice
them in their daily behaviour and engagement with others, such as being <strong>Responsible</strong> and <strong>Respectful</strong> and
being <strong>Disciplined.</strong> 
<br>
<br>The values and learning dispositions in Our Bowenian Pledge will shape
how Bowenians learn, behave, and grow.</p>
