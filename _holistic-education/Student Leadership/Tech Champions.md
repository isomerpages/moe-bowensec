The Tech Champions aim to create a ripple effect by emulating qualities of using ICT responsibly and sharing their skills and expertise to enrich their peersâ€™ ICT usage. Besides the day-to-day support in the utilisation of ICT learning platforms in class, Senior Tech Champions also conduct workshops targeted for different levels e.g. Google Productivity Apps to inspire others to embrace Technology for learning.
