## CCA Leaders
#### *Shining Bright, Expanding Realities*

CCA Leaders are the beacons of the CCA Leadership. Appointed at Secondary 3 after going through a selection process which includes interviews and observations by their CCA teachers. More than just assisting in the teachers on running CCA, 

CCA Leaders aim to build a vibrant and positive environment for all Bowenians to learn and contribute to the school spirit through the events such as Secondary 1 Orientation, CCA leaders workshops and CCA exchange programmes. 


They also ensure all skills are imparted to their juniors through mentorship programmes, where they are able to lend an listening ear to their juniors and share effective strategies to lead their CCA members.
