## Passion, Service, Leadership 
#### *To Uplift and Support Bowenians*  
Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in Bowen Secondary School are trained to listen actively and respond with empathy to promote positive mental wellbeing in school.  
  
Appointed at Secondary 2 and 3 after going through a rigorous selection process, PSLs are guided at every point to hone their skills as a peer supporter and leader. Apart from encouraging early help-seeking behaviour and exemplify positive coping strategies among peers,  
  
PSLs actively contribute to a caring school culture by conducting activities that strengthen peer bonding.
