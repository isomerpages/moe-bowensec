## Class Leaders 
#### *Dream, Believe and Achieve*

Class Leaders form an essential wing of Bowen Student Leadership. They support their form teachers and peers in managing administrative duties pertaining to their classes. Good rapport with their classmates help to ensure that the classroom is conducive for learning. 

By planning and executing class-based events like FCBT and school events, we hope that our Class Leaders can promote a positive class culture which serves to strengthen class ties and serve the wider school community.
