# Vision
 In line with our school vision of Every Bowenian A Leader, we aim to develop confident and selfless student leaders with strong sense of agency.
 
### The 6 Core Values
The six core values of Bowen act as a strong foundation and guiding compass for all Bowenians in their leadership journey. More than just skills, we strongly believe our leaders must be inculcated with the right set of values to go far and wide.  


### The 4 E-xperiences
All our programs are designed with 4 E-xperiences: 
* Explore
* Embrace
* Empower 
* Elevate

Through the programs, Bowenians will explore and discover more about themselves and different leadership experiences. They will learn to embrace their every trait and differences with others to reach their fullest potential. They will also be empowered with skills and opportunities to plan, lead, and execute class and school wide events. Ultimately, elevating their leadership skills to take up bigger responsibilities in future.

# Mission
With the six core values and four E-xperiences guiding our leadership curriculum, our Bowenians are always working towards our mission continually through their years with us. Being inspired to serve others. Develop their character by stepping out of their comfort zone with unwavering courage. Nurture their own learning by acquiring a mindset of life-long learning.

# Leadership Development

Leadership development in Bowen takes a three-tiered approach. Each tier highlight different types of leadership involved and programs for each Bowenians.

### Tier 1 (Self-Leadership) 
“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” – Aristotle. Before any leadership training, all Bowenians will go through various programs to explore and understand themselves better, and reinforce their identity.  Sec 1s and selected Secondary 2 students will go through a self-profiling workshop (e.g. Tetra Map) at the start of the year and enter The Scaffold Program (TSP) respectively. All Bowenians will also be exposed to various self-discovery CCE lessons and Bowen Explore opportunities to discover their areas of interest. Concurrently, all Bowenians go through Values-in-Action (VIA) and Applied Learning Program (ALP) to inspire their agency to serve by putting themselves in others’ shoes and discover their leadership ability. With more self-clarity, all Sec 2 and 3 Bowenians are empowered with the five practices of the model of leadership espoused by Kouzes and Posner (Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart).  
### Tier 2 (Specialised Leadership) 
Secondary 1 to 3 Bowenians heed the call and undergo various selection and training processes to take up specialised leadership roles, such as Student Council, Peer Support Leaders (PSL), CCA Leaders, Class Leaders (CL), Tech Champions (TC) and CCE Ambassadors. Each leadership roles are closely guided and empowered at their various specialised areas to hone their leadership skills they have gained, by organising classes and school-wide events. Elevating their level of leadership, Secondary 3 Leaders will step up to start mentoring their juniors on their leadership journey through close guiding of their duties and frequent reflection sessions.

### Tier 3 (School Leadership) 
The **APEX** of the Bowen Leadership are the** EXCOs** of the each leadership: Student Council, PSL, CCA Leaders, CL and TC. These students have been carefully selected by teachers in-charge and the school leaders. 

Our EXCOs are expected to be highly responsible are expected to lead their respective leaderships into different initiatives while they work closely together with the teachers. 

They seek for opportunities to forge partnership and collaboration with teachers and other student leaders (e.g. the Secondary 1 Orientation, Teachers’ Day and Bowen Open House) and external communities (e.g. AWWA, MINDS, other secondary and primary schools). 

Ultimately, they will be leading their respective leadership group to soar into greater heights.
