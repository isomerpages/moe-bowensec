The Bowen Student Council (BSC) is an important platform to nurture future leaders as it aims to develop confident student leaders who demonstrate school values whilst being in service to the school and the community. 

Student councillors are given multiple opportunities to hone their leadership skills by assisting in organising various events, such as Secondary 1 Orientation and Teachers’ Day Celebrations. 

The councillors also help to serve the school by doing daily council duties and provide support during key school events such as Speech Day and Meet Parent Sessions.
