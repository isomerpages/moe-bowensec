Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students to look ahead to education and work-decisions beyond Bowen.  ECG is about helping students to make informed decisions for a successful transition from school to post-secondary education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning. Through ECG, social-emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability, and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

### Career Guidance for our students after Bowen

Bowen’s ECG curriculum aims to deepen Bowenians’ understanding of self and relate schooling to different education and career pathways.  At the secondary level, we focus on Exploration (at the primary level, the focus is on Awareness, while at the pre-university level, the focus is on Career Planning).

Through ECG, we seek to help Bowenians:

*   Explore the career world  
    
*   Understand the relevant course of study, and  
    
*   Develop awareness of their skills, interests and values. 

Our key ECG Programmes include:

*   Secondary 2 subject combination briefings  
    
*   Secondary 3 Work Attachment Experience  
    
*   Elective Modules  
    
*   Career Fair Visits  
    
*   Career Talk by Industries  
    
*   Post-Secondary institutional Visits  
    
*   Talks on Post-Secondary pathways  
    
*   Post-Secondary talks by higher institutions  
    
*   DSA (JC) and EAE Preparatory talks and workshops
