Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students to look ahead to education and work-decisions beyond Bowen.&nbsp; ECG is about helping students to make informed decisions for a successful transition from school to post-secondary education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning. Through ECG, social-emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability, and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

### Career Guidance for our students after Bowen

Bowen’s ECG curriculum aims to deepen Bowenians’ understanding of self and relate schooling to different education and career pathways.&nbsp; At the secondary level, we focus on Exploration (at the primary level, the focus is on Awareness, while at the pre-university level, the focus is on Career Planning).

Through ECG, we seek to help Bowenians:

*   Explore the career world  
    
*   Understand the relevant course of study, and  
    
*   Develop awareness of their skills, interests and&nbsp;values. 

Our key ECG Programmes include:

*   Secondary 2 subject combination briefings  
    
*   Secondary 3 Work Attachment Experience  
    
*   Elective Modules  
    
*   Career Fair Visits  
    
*   Career Talk by Industries  
    
*   Post-Secondary institutional Visits  
    
*   Talks on Post-Secondary pathways  
    
*   Post-Secondary talks by higher institutions  
    
*   DSA (JC) and EAE Preparatory talks and workshops
