Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.

To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE need to remain current and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with this in mind, to help our students navigate the realities of their time.

### Goals of CCE 2021

### The Enactment of CCE

A holistic approach to CCE involves explicit teaching, and reinforcement and application of learning. Multiple learning platforms are tapped on to help students internalise values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. These platforms include CCE Lessons, key Student Development Experiences, and school-based initiatives. Key Student Development Experiences include Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experiences, National Education (NE) commemorative days, outdoor adventure learning cohort camps, student leadership development programmes and Values in Action (ChANgeMaker pgm).

The B.E.

It was **centred on the values** of the respective levels and had **broad themes to guide the spiral approach** of some programmes/activities.  

The programmes/activities were split into 3 Tiers:  
1. School-wide  
2. Cohort-wide  
3. Programmes/Activities for selected group/streams of Students
