<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies,
and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to
grow holistically and learn for life.</p>
<p>To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world,
the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE need to remain current
and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with this in mind, to help our
students navigate the realities of their time.</p>
<h3>Goals of CCE 2021</h3>

<h3>The Enactment of CCE</h3>
<p>A holistic approach to CCE involves explicit teaching, and reinforcement
and application of learning. Multiple learning platforms are tapped on
to help students internalise values, social-emotional competencies, and
citizenship dispositions. These platforms include CCE Lessons, key Student
Development Experiences, and school-based initiatives. Key Student Development
Experiences include Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Education and Career
Guidance (ECG) experiences, National Education (NE) commemorative days,
outdoor adventure learning cohort camps, student leadership development
programmes and Values in Action (ChANgeMaker pgm).</p>

<p>The B.E. Map brings together&nbsp;<strong>greater coherence and alignment</strong>&nbsp;in
the programmes and activities that contribute towards the&nbsp;<strong>holistic development</strong>&nbsp;of
our students to achieve the school’s vision of&nbsp;<em>Every Bowenian – a passionate&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Learner, Leader and Champion</em></strong><em>&nbsp;of character and life</em>.
It was&nbsp;<strong>centred on the values</strong>&nbsp;of the respective
levels and had&nbsp;<strong>broad themes to guide the spiral approach</strong>&nbsp;of
some&nbsp;programmes/activities.</p>
