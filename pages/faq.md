Parents are encouraged to pay their children’s fees through GIRO so that the pupils do not have to bring large sums of cash to school. GIRO deduction will be made monthly from February to December.

**OPTION 2: CHEQUE**

For cheque payment, either post the cheque or submit it to our General Office. Please make cheques payable to "Bowen Secondary School".
