<p>The student librarians help the school operate and maintain the school
library as a place for knowledge building and active learning. Specifically,
members assist the school librarian in providing students access to a variety
of print and non-print resources. Besides carrying out their regular duties,
student librarians are always actively providing service to the school
in trying to innovate ways to promote a love for reading and staying curious
among their schoolmates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The library holds a collection of print and non-print materials which
include books, magazines, newspapers, and multimedia resources. Members
of the club are given exclusive privileges to these services and are taught
the basics of operating a library system. Members not only hone their leadership
qualities through assuming positions such as Head Librarian, Secretary
and Level leaders in the library committee but also reap the benefits of
learning to work as a team through their engagement in the varied activities
organised for them throughout the year.</p>
