<h3>About Bowen Boys Brigade (BB)</h3>
<p>We seek to nurture boys based on values through a well-balanced programme,
effective leadership of NCOs and officers, fostering close relationships
amongst members, their parents, the church and the school. The Boys’ Brigade
sets itself apart from the other uniformed groups by focusing on Social,
Physical, Spiritual &amp; Educational development. This has given our members
an all-rounded personality. BB Boys will gain leadership skills as one
progresses through the ranks.</p>

<p>A typical BB Boy can expect to stand as a Sergeant with glittering badges
on a set of crisp blue uniforms, leading a Company of Boys on parade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a member of the BB, one will learn new skills, go on outdoor expeditions,
archery sessions, biking expeditions and adventure, make new friends and
develop confidence and challenges to their creative thinking skills.</p>

Competitions. The Company was awarded the JM Fraser Award for Excellence
(Silver).</p>
