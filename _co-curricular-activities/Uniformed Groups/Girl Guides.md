<p>Girl Guides provides an education in life skills which encourages each
girl to be a responsible citizen and to lead a useful life. The activities

Total Defence, Cook’s Badge, Artist, Craft, Thrift, WAGGGS interest Badges

<p>In the Girl Guides, we are committed to the development of our girls into
confident leaders. Guides will be given the opportunity to develop their
potential as leaders through various leadership courses organised by Girl
Guides Headquarters. Our Girl Guides had also represented in the school
National Day Parade. Girl Guides believe in giving back to the society.
Guides organised our termly visits to Sree Narayana Mission Home and also
assisted Girl Guides Headquarters in fundraising through the selling of
Girl Guides cookies annually.</p>
