### About Bowen Indian Dance
The Indian Dance CCA was established to provide an opportunity to appreciate the fine aesthetics of the art. Dancers are instructed in learning the basics of the various Indian Dance forms such as Thappattam, Silambam, Contemporary, Bollywood and Baratha Natyam.&nbsp;

  

The Indian Dance has been invited to perform at many public and national events apart from school events, It was a great honour for the team to present an item at the Ground-Breaking ceremony for the Indian Heritage Centre which was attended by the President and the cabinet ministers of Singapore and also at the annual Tamil Language month Launch ceremonies. Every year 3-4 students qualify for the Dance Talent Development programme organised by NAC and MOE. Under the tutelage of Ms Vijaya and the committed Indian dance CCA teachers,&nbsp;

The Indian Dance club has been achieving distinction at SYF since 2005.We will scale greater heights and also continue to serve the community through our VIA. We look forward to recruiting both boys and girls from all races.
