<h3>About Bowen Indian Dance</h3>
<p>The Indian Dance CCA was established to provide an opportunity to appreciate
the fine aesthetics of the art. Dancers are instructed in learning the
basics of the various Indian Dance forms such as Thappattam, Silambam,
Contemporary, Bollywood and Baratha Natyam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian Dance has been invited to perform at many public and national
events apart from school events, It was a great honour for the team to
present an item at the Ground-Breaking ceremony for the Indian Heritage
Centre which was attended by the President and the cabinet ministers of
Singapore and also at the annual Tamil Language month Launch ceremonies.
Every year 3-4 students qualify for the Dance Talent Development programme
organised by NAC and MOE. Under the tutelage of Ms Vijaya and the committed
Indian dance CCA teachers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian Dance club has been achieving distinction at SYF since 2005.We
will scale greater heights and also continue to serve the community through
our VIA. We look forward to recruiting both boys and girls from all races.</p>
