<p>Dance is a form of art and it is also a creative expression of the ideas
and feelings of individuals. It allows students to express their ideas
about the world around them through a nonverbal means of communication.
The Bowen Dance Club has over the years introduced and exposed students
to different genres of dance e.g. Hip Hop, Street Jazz, Modern Dance, Wacking,
BBoying etc. We have a comprehensive and structured dance programme to
help students learn dance in a fun and easy way.</p>
<p>During our weekly dance sessions, our experienced and dedicated instructors
train students in dance techniques and prepare them for competitions and
performances.</p>
<p>Bowen Dance Club has participated in various competitions namely, Singapore
Youth Festival, SUPER 24!, Danceworks!, Let’s Work It Challenge!, FUYO
BBoy Battle and achieved several awards making the school proud. Every
student has the opportunity to perform on stage and showcase their talent
during our public performances and various school events.</p>
<p>We aim to provide a fruitful and meaningful experience for each student
and help build their confidence, increase their self-esteem and perseverance
through dance.</p>
