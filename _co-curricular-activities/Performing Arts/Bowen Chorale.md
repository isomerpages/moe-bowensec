### About Bowen Chorale

![](/images/CCAs/Performing%20Arts/Choir/choir%20main.jpg)

The Bowen Chorale provides an opportunity for students with a passion in singing to further hone their abilities and techniques in voice.&nbsp; It provides potential singers with an opportunity to develop and improve their musicianship, whether in theory or practical. Students will also be given the opportunity to perform on stage and gain self-confidence with every performance.&nbsp;

  

We hope to&nbsp;instill&nbsp;confidence, resilience and a spirit of excellence through their experience in Bowen Chorale.&nbsp;

  

In 2018, Bowen Chorale embarked on its first self-run showcase titled “Lumière”, in which our members trained relentlessly and gave their best, embracing fully our motto “Tuning Towards Perfection”. Bowen Chorale is also a regular participant of Singapore Youth Festival (Choir) and has achieved Certificate of Accomplishment consistently since 2015.
