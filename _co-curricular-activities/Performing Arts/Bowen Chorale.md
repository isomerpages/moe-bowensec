<p>The Bowen Chorale provides an opportunity for students with a passion
in singing to further hone their abilities and techniques in voice.&nbsp;
It provides potential singers with an opportunity to develop and improve
their musicianship, whether in theory or practical. Students will also
be given the opportunity to perform on stage and gain self-confidence with
every performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope to&nbsp;instill&nbsp;confidence, resilience and a spirit of excellence
through their experience in Bowen Chorale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Bowen Chorale embarked on its first self-run showcase titled
“Lumière”, in which our members trained relentlessly and gave their best,
embracing fully our motto “Tuning Towards Perfection”. Bowen Chorale is
also a regular participant of Singapore Youth Festival (Choir) and has
achieved Certificate of Accomplishment consistently since 2015.</p>
