<p>The Military Band is about respect, responsibility and resilience. It’s
also about drive, determination and creativity. It is a manifestation of
the school’s vision of shaping self-belief and aspirations. Our strive
for excellence have driven us to achieve remarkable results in SYF Arts
Presentation for Band (Marching) since 1991.</p>
<p>The success of the Bowen Military Band is not only a reflection of the
strong school culture and rich nurturing environment in the Performing
Arts but also a reflection of the school’s strong beliefs in a rigorous
and innovative values-based holistic education. This educational experience
will shape students’ beliefs so that they will be ready to serve their
communities, the Singapore society and fellow human beings in this globalised
world.</p>
