### CCAs in Bowen

CCAs are an integral part of a Bowenian's holistic education. Through CCAs, Bowenians discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among Bowenians from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens their sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and our nation.

In Bowen, every Bowenian takes part in at least one CCA taken from the following options:


*   Uniformed Groups
*   Performing Arts
*   Sports
*   Clubs and Societies

### What is LEAPS 2.0 Framework?


To provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has implement an updated **LEAPS framework**, **LEAPS 2.0**, starting with Secondary 1 students from 2014. Using this updated framework, Bowen has aligned our co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic development in terms of life skills, competencies and values.
