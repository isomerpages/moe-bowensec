<h3>CCAs in Bowen</h3>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of a Bowenian's holistic education. Through
CCAs, Bowenians discover their interests and talents while developing values
and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA
also promotes friendships among Bowenians from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration
and deepens their sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and&nbsp;our nation.</p>
<p>In Bowen, every Bowenian takes part in at least one CCA taken from the
following options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Uniformed Groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performing Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clubs and Societies</p>

</ul>
