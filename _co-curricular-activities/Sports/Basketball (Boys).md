<p>Bowen’s basketball CCA started out as a recreation sport in 2002 with
members who were passionate about the game. The CCA continues to attract
such enthusiastic pupils and have since developed 2 school teams to compete
in the North Zone Inter-Schools Competition (B &amp; C Div Boys). The teams
also participate in other basketball programmes and competitions organised
by external organisations throughout the year.</p>
<p>Membership in the Basketball CCA has increased in the past few years.
The school teams have also participated in various tournaments organised
by neighbouring schools and community clubs.</p>
