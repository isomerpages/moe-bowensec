<p>Football is one of the more popular sports in Bowen. Through the training
sessions and matches, students learn to play competitive football and cultivate
important life values like resilience, teamwork and respect. The boys receive
professional coaching from head coach Mr Lim Queen Cher who monitors the
team's progress as well as partners the team of football CCA teachers in
building the students’ character.&nbsp; To ensure that all CCA members
get a chance to represent the school in football, they are also regularly
entered to participate in other external competitions (Street soccer, FUTSAL)
organised by organisations like FAS, NTUC, S-League Clubs and welfare homes.</p>
<p>Members identified to lead the CCA are provided leadership training by
the Bowen Council Board and Outward Bound School; they are also afforded
various opportunities to apply what they learn as camp facilitators, team
captains and event coordinators. The Boys Football CCA also initiates Value-in-action
projects that has benefitted special needs children, the elderly and various
charity organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the boys’ and girls’ footballing adventures are chronicled in
