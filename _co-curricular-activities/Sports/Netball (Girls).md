<p>Netball is a popular and enjoyable team game that has been played competitively
in Bowen for many years. Training sessions are geared towards learning
to play strategically as a team, developing ball-handling skills, improving
agility, flexibility and stamina. Netball also effectively promotes the
physical and social development of each individual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have 2 girls teams (B and C Division) that participates regularly in
the North Zone Inter-Schools competitions and friendly games with other
schools and carnivals. Selected netballers are also sent for the Sports
Umpire Award workshops to develop their leadership potential. These girls
will then be given the opportunity to&nbsp;organise&nbsp;netball activities
such as Bowen Netball Carnival for Primary and Secondary Schools. We also
hold annual camps to promote team bonding and leadership skills. They also
take part in volunteer work to assist in Nations Cup, Netball Super League&nbsp;and&nbsp;other
Netball Singapore events.</p>
