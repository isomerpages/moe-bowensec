The Bowen Bullets Girls have been playing The Beautiful Game (joga bonito!) in the National C and B girls' competitions since 2009 under the guidance of coach Ms Yeong Sheau Shyan. The C Division team emerged as National Champions in the 2011 and 2012 C girls’ competitions, and wrote history by achieving this without conceding any goals in 2012. In 2013 and 2014, the girls brought home both the C and B Division titles, as well as the’ Most Promising Player’ awards for both divisions in 2013, and the ‘Top Scorer’ awards for both divisions in 2014.

  

  

In 2015, the B Division girls were the 1st Runners Up, while their C Division juniors successfully defended the title to win the championship for the 4th consecutive year. C Division captain Mira Ruzana and B Division Vice-Captain Emilia Natasha were awarded the ‘Most Promising Player’ awards for standing out in their respective tournaments. In 2016 and 2017, the B Division girls team emerged as National Champions and the C Division team were the 1st Runners Up. The Bullets Apart from the National Championships, the girls take part in various enrichment and character building activities such as team building camps, the FAS Referee Introductory Course, futsal competitions, basketball, rugby, and rock climbing.
