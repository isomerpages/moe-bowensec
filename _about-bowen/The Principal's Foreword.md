We now live in an age where the ways we live, learn and work are rapidly and continually being redefined. For many of us, the past few years have been **Rapid, Unpredictable, Paradoxical and Tangled**.   

  

Amidst change and dis**RUPT**ion, our school community has embraced key growth opportunities in line with our vision of: _Every Bowenian a Passionate Learner, Leader and Champion_.

  

_Learning for Life_ and _Self-Directed Learning_ will be crucial for us to thrive in a future that is uncertain yet holds many opportunities. This requires new skillsets, toolsets, and most importantly, mindsets. To equip Bowenians with the **agility to learn, unlearn and relearn**, we have developed a total curriculum which emphasises active and responsible learning with technology. 

  

Through this, they are **R.E.A.D.Y for the Bowen Experience (BE)**. The **BE** includes rich experiences such as **Full Subject-Based Banding** and **Bowen.Explore!** to grow Bowenians’ individual strengths as well as enable them to explore their interests across a wide range of life domains. **Student agency** is leveraged to grow Bowenians’ metacognitive and self-regulative capabilities to learn for life.

  

Guided by our school motto, I Believe, Therefore I am, we believe that all Bowenians can step up and accept the challenge **to lead in their own ways**. Through both school-wide as well as customised leadership development opportunities, Bowenians grow as **future-ready leaders** who can work in diverse teams, build positive relationships with others, and look at the truth and wisdom of multiple perspectives. With change and complexity becoming ‘new normals’ our aspiring leaders must navigate, they will need not just to look outwards but also seek inwards. As their physical, intellectual, emotional and social health are important for thriving, we have also strengthened our efforts to help Bowenians develop **self-leadership** through the BE. By leading self and taking care of their own holistic well-being, they can then better lead in service of others.

  

As champions, Bowenians harness their learning and leadership capabilities to make a positive difference to the world. Our signature **ChANgeMakers Programme**, which innovatively integrates our Applied Learning and Learning for Life Programmes, nurtures Bowenians as empathetic, socially responsible and inventive thinkers who view problems as opportunities to engineer change. By tapping on their entrepreneurial skills in service of others, and by gaining confidence through applying their strengths, Bowenians are poised to become purposeful changemakers of the future.

  

All of the above would not have been possible without the invaluable support of all our parents, alumni, and community partners. We continue to build **strong synergy and growing our ecology**, where as an integral part of the community, the school continues to create value not just for Bowenians, but also for the wider society.

  

Even as we keep an eye on the future, we also draw from the school’s traditional strengths that have been nourished since the school’s founding. Our **fundamental values, culture of care, and spirit of ‘Dare to try’** will continue to guide us with passion, genuineness, benevolence, confidence, vibrancy and imagination, as they have done, over the years.

  

It has been said that the best way to predict the future is to create it. We celebrated our 40th Anniversary in 2022 and are looking forward to writing the next chapter of the Bowen story together with our students and stakeholders. Through discovering, dreaming and daring together, let the Bowen star continue to shine brightly, and for all Bowenians to reach for theirs, by doing good and doing well. 

  

We invite you to join us to **BE Bold, BE Well, BE You, and BE Happy**, like various leading lights who have done so before you!
