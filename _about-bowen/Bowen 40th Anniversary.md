### The Bowen 40th Anniversary Theme
![](/images/40th_BE_logo2%20png.png)

The theme for our 40th Anniversary is **BElonging**, **BEnefitting Lives**, and **BElieving**.

It reflects the three things that best represent the Bowen Experience from the time our school first opened its doors to students, as well as the collective aspirations of our Bowen family as we look to the future with hope and purpose.
