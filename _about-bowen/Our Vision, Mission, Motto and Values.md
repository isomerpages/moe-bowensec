<center>The six arrows represent Bowen's Brand Personality of 

<b>Passion, Genuineness, Benevolence,</b><br>
<b>Confidence, Vibrancy and Imagination.</b></center>

Skewed in one direction to create a notable rotation denoting the shaping of aspirations and self-belief, the six arrows converge to form a star, which symbolizes distinction through the core values of <b>Respect, Responsibility, Compassion, Resilience, Teamwork and Excellence.</b>

  

Together with the corporate colours of **Blue (Youth)** and **Purple (Passion)**. The distinctive logo epitomizes the harmonious balance between the left and right brain.
