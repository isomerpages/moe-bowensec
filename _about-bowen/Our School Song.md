# The Bowen Anthem  

  
To you Bowen we come,  <br>
To seek wisdom and knowledge,  <br>
Achieve success in studies and play,  <br>
Here we strive to excel.

  

**Chorus**

Arise Bowenians!  <br>
Heed the call.  <br>
Strive for excellence,  <br>
And give your all.

  
Diligence and perseverance,  <br>
Kindness to young and old,  <br>
Humility and honesty,  <br>
All these values we uphold.

  

It is to you, Bowen,  <br>
We pledge our loyalty,  <br>
Your name we strive to glorify,  <br>
With honour and dignity.<br>
