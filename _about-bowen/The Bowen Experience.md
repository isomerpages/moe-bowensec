The Bowen Experience is our annual open house where graduating primary 6 students of the current academic year and their parents come and find out more about our school.

This year, the Bowen Experience Open House was held on 16 November 2024 from 9am to 12pm.

## Principal's Talk
Our principal shared a glimpse into what a Bowenian will experience during his/her stay. Do check out the YouTube Link once it is available.
