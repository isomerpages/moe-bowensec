### Bowen 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
Bowen celebrated her 4**0<sup>th</sup>Anniversary in 2022**. The school logo was updated for a year to commemorate the anniversary before reverting to the current logo in 2023.

The theme for our 40th Anniversary was **BElonging**, **BEnefitting** Lives, and **BElieving**. It reflects the three things that best represent the Bowen Experience from the time our school first opened its doors to students, as well as the collective aspirations of our Bowen family as we look to the future with hope and purpose.
