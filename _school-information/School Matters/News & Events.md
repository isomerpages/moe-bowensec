![](/images/School%20Events/2023/infopic%20bowen%20experience.jpg)

### Online Purchase of 2024 Textbooks and Uniforms for Sec 2, 3 and 4 students
For a safe and smooth customer experience, the sale of 2024 textbooks and uniforms will be conducted online. <br>

From **Tuesday, 14 Nov 2023**, you may begin to make online purchase from the bookshop and uniform supplierâ€™s website. <br>

To ensure that every student is able to obtain the required textbooks/uniforms and other related learning materials before the start of the new academic year, there will be a window period for purchasing or ordering them from the school supplier. <br>

Orders for textbooks/uniforms and other related learning materials should be submitted to the school supplier **between 14 Nov and 15 Dec 2023.** The school supplier will fulfil all orders placed during the window period. However, any orders placed outside the window period or with other suppliers cannot be guaranteed.<br>

*Please note: the Bookshop &amp; Uniform Supplier at school will not be able to serve walk-in customers who have not placed online orders beforehand. This is to provide them time to pre-pack the orders*.
