### Payment Mode for School Fees

Parents can choose to pay the monthly school fees by the various methods:  
  

*   **General Interbank Recurring Order (GIRO)**  <br>
Parents are strongly encouraged to sign up for GIRO for payment of monthly fees for school bills. This also allows the payment of enrichment programmes (for students without Edusave account & students whose Edusave is insufficient) and school charges (e.g. pay for locker rental)  
   
*   **Cash Payment**  <br>
Cash-paying parents may make payment through the following options :

	*   AXS Payment Facilities  <br>
	AXS kiosks, AXS e-station (Internet) or AXS m-station (mobile app)
	*   PayNow  
    Parents will see a [Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR)](https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/e-payments/sgqr) printed on their MOE and School Bills. They can simply scan the personalised SGQR and pay with any NETS or PayNow payment schemes, without having to provide any payment reference details.
		
_NOTE: GIRO deduction is carried out on a monthly basis during the year, and is made on the 26th of every month from February to December. Fees for the months of January and February will be deducted together in February. If the 26th falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday, the deduction will be made on the next working day. Please ensure there are sufficient funds in your bank account throughout the year to facilitate fees payment._

### Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)

Students who require financial support for school fees, textbooks, uniforms or meals are strongly encouraged to apply for support through  
  
MOE financial assistance schemes (FAS) or school-based financial assistance schemes (FAS)
