<h3>Sec 2 - 4/5 Online Purchase of Textbooks and Uniform</h3>
<p>Sales will be conducted online to manage the number of visitors to the
school as we are transiting towards living with COVID-19 in a careful and
controlled manner. *Please note: the Bookshop &amp; Uniform Vendor at school
will not serve walk-in customers who have not placed online orders beforehand.
This is to provide them time to pre-pack the orders.</p>
<p>If you have further queries, please contact the School General Office
at 6385 9466.</p>
