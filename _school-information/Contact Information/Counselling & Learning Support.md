### BOWEN PARENTS REACH OUT


**What’s the story morning glory?**

  

\-     Is your child/ward feeling overwhelmed?  
\-     Is there something weighing heavily on his/her mind?  
\-     Are you looking to find solution or resolve a difficult situation?  
  

Would you like your child/ward to have a TENDER LOVING CHAT with someone in school, someone who could walk alongside with him/her to navigate this situation.  
  

Having someone to talk may just ease the burden that is weighing heavily on his or heart and mind.
