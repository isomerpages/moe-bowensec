&gt; _“This philosophy guides our thinking at the Ministry of Education, and it is why we encourage Parent Support Groups, or PSGs, to work hand-in-hand with our schools in their parenting journey. And if you are not already members of PSGs in your children's schools, please be one.”_
&gt; 
&gt; _“__The advantages are two-fold: On one hand, parents can pick up tips and insights from each other and better guide their children. On the other hand, positive school-home partnerships can help our children develop self-management skills, have ownership over their learning, develop a sense of purpose and build resilience. Our schools and parents can also work closely to support our children in pursuing their strengths and interests, and impart good values and attitudes."_
&gt; 
&gt; _“I will give a few examples of the good work done by some of our PSGs.._&nbsp;

&gt; _Bowen Secondary School's PSG has also worked closely with the school to support their parents. They have a mentoring programme where fellow parents share useful tips and resources with one another. The PSG also helms a "For Parents by Parents" segment during the school's Meet-the-Parents sessions and holds Zoom sessions to engage parents in leading topics such as ways to build positive relationships with their children_

&gt; _“To support all PSGs, MOE launched a Mental Well-being Resource Guide earlier this year with tips on how parents can be peer and resource supporters for each other. You can check our website for this Well-being Resource Guide. This guide is complemented by an online PSG repository that provides the most up-to-date resources that PSGs can refer to for their ongoing efforts to promote mental well-being among children.”_
