### SIGN-UP FOR TRIPLE P TEENS SEMINAR

Dear Parent/Guardian of Secondary 1 Bowenians for 2023,  
  
Methodist Welfare Services Family Support Programme (MWS FSP) has been appointed by Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to partner with your child’s school to conduct secular parenting programmes. We are pleased to invite you to attend our fully subsidised, Positive Parenting Program® (Triple P) webinars via Zoom.  
  
Triple P is one of the world’s most effective parenting programmes that equips parents with evidence-based parenting skills. Not only has this programme been proven to improve children’s behaviours, it has also significantly improved parenting confidence and satisfaction. Triple P has also helped parents build stronger relationships with their children. For the upcoming webinar, our MSF-certified speaker will focus on topics to help you manage your child/ward’s transition to secondary school. More details of the webinar can be found in the attached infographics.  
  
Registration will be on first come first served basis. Your full attendance for all three webinars will be required when you register. Once your registration is confirmed, MWS FSP will send you an acknowledgment email by 3rd February 2023. More information, including the Zoom link and worksheets will also be shared with you via the email address which you will be required to provide in the registration form. If you wish to cancel your registration, you may drop us an email at mwsfspnorth@mws.sg. Upon completion of all three webinars, a set of complimentary hardcopy tip sheets will be sent to you via your child’s school. In the event that the webinar reaches full capacity, MWS FSP will contact you again for the next run of webinars.  
  
We look forward to your participation in our webinars!
