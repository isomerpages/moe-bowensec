### SIGN-UP FOR TRIPLE P TEENS SEMINAR

Dear Parent/Guardian of Secondary 1 Bowenians,
  
Methodist Welfare Services Family Support Programme (MWS FSP) has been appointed by Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to partner with your child’s school to conduct secular parenting programmes. We are pleased to invite you to attend our fully subsidised, Positive Parenting Program® (Triple P) webinars via Zoom.  
  
Triple P is one of the world’s most effective parenting programmes that equips parents with evidence-based parenting skills. Not only has this programme been proven to improve children’s behaviours, it has also significantly improved parenting confidence and satisfaction. Triple P has also helped parents build stronger relationships with their children. For the upcoming webinar, our MSF-certified speaker will focus on topics to help you manage your child/ward’s transition to secondary school. More details of the webinar can be found in the attached infographics.  
  
Registration will be on first come first served basis. Your full attendance for all three webinars will be required when you register. 
  
We look forward to your participation in our webinars!
